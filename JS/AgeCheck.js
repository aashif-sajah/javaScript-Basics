let age =18;

if (age>=18){

}

// In this snippet, we have an if statement that checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, the console will log "You can watch 18+ Movies". If the age is less than 18, the console will log "You are not eligible to watch 18+ Movies". This is a simple age check that determines if the user is old enough to watch 18+ movies.

(age>=18)? console.log("You can Watch 18+ Movies") : console.log("You are not eligible to watch 18+ Movies");
